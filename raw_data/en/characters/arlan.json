Their owner looks more relaxed than she usually does before the researchers, and absentmindedly lets out a huge yawn.<br /><br />\"You're up late. Not going to bed?\"<br />\"I'm feeling anxious, so I'm just out for a patrol...\"<br />\"I just updated the firmware for the defense shield, and security systems are all operating smoothly.\"<br />\"Maybe I'm overthinking things, but...\"<br />\"I understand. You're the head of security, and I trust your instincts.\"<br /><br />The space station remains brightly lit and operates without a stop. They each return to their respective posts.<br /><br />They both know that regardless of the protection of Madam Herta's fame, the defensive measures around the space station, and the round-the-clock vigilance of the Security Department \u2014 if a disaster was to occur...<br /><br />It would only take seconds.",

There aren't any more life signs in there.\"<br /><br />He thought he could trust Asta until the moment when countless Antimatter Legion pawns pour towards him like a tsunami. The signal from the watcher zone is faint. Asta won't be able to see this situation.<br /><br />He is now standing, alone, in the elevator. He has to make a decision, even if he has to disobey Asta's orders \u2014 No matter the cost, he has to block access to the elevator to save everyone. He cannot allow these monsters to get to the master control zone.<br /><br />\"Sorry, Miss Asta...\"<br /><br />The Antimatter Legion strikes him down from behind before he can explain himself. He falls, and his remote communications disconnects.<br /><br />He had never hesitated, whether working in Miss Asta's home or after becoming Herta Space Station's head of Security Department. He had always taken for granted that, since Miss Asta decided to head in one direction, he has to follow her.<br /><br />Arlan raises his head with great difficulty, and the monsters move closer to him. He had never disobeyed an order from Miss Asta before. This is the first time.<br /><br />\"Hopefully it won't be the last time.\"<br /><br />This thought pops up in his head.<br /><br />Propping himself up with his greatsword, he slowly and firmly stands up.",
