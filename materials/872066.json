  "lore": "The Department of Implement Arts of the Herta Space Station once did an interesting experiment. Its researchers added three Aidens of vector to a Stone of The Hunt on a topological loop band, making the stone chase itself. Thus, the stone was able to achieve limited perpetual motion under specific conditions. The department was not concerned with the loss of Path power in the experiment. Instead, they took notice of another small phenomenon: to tread on its Path, the stone moved at a very low velocity, but the speed was gradually picking up in small increments. The researchers leveraged this and produced Topological Acceleration Band. Other than for workout purposes, its use is very limited at the current stage.<br /><br />\"Say, if we mass-produce it, like, infinitely, could it drain all the energy of a certain Path?\"<br />\"No idea... Currently, we don't know much about how Paths work.\"",
