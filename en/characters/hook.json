One day, mom went into the Fragmentum, and never came out again. Mom loved eating stone-grilled olm.

Dad secretly told me to save the money. He also told me that he was uncomfortable staying there, and wanted to go home. So I went to daddy and told him I wanted to go home with my dad. But when daddy and I went to see him, he stopped talking.\"<br /><br />\"Daddy was on his knees and crying, but I didn't understand what was going on. Daddy explained to me that dad missed mom so much that he went to see her inside his dreams. I asked daddy, when will my dad wake up? Daddy just kept crying though and didn't answer me...\"<br /><br />\"I didn't \u2014 didn't cry! No... Natasha, I don't need any tissues...\"<br /><br />\"...Actually later I secretly asked the doctor something. I know that my dad is dead and won't come back forever, and mom is the same...
