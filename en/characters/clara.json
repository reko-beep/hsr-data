She believes locking the gates is an 'incomprehensible' act.

I once said of her, 'her behavior is more based on pure rationality.' If we take this probable result as a base and revisit my conclusion, I cannot view it as an error \u2014 but I admit that it is biased.\"<br /><br />\"With the results of this calculation, Clara has also proved one thing: having true rationality is not the key to changing the status quo, but rather that her sincere and passionate emotion overturned all calculations and completely reversed Belobog's doomed fate. However, unless new external forces intervene, the probability of this is less than <nobr>0.25272%</nobr>, which places it in the low probability category. Further research on these calculations are paused.\"<br /><br />\"Today, the probability of survival in the Underworld has not seen a significant upward trend over the last five cycles.
