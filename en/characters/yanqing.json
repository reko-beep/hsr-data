For millennia, several talented unicorns have emerged ahead of the pack during the hunt. However, Yanqing earned a military commission before he was a teen. Some would criticize that \"the general is absurd\" on this matter.<br /><br />However, this genius' debut on the battlefield was even more explosive, and any critical voices soon fell silent.<br /><br />When hunting near a distant star, the monstrously huge mechabeast Windguard created by the Denizens of Abundance was pulverizing defense forces, as though they were ants. But this kid met against it face-to-face, claiming its scalp and routing the enemy to the point of collapse.<br /><br />As for subsequent victories: He broke the borisin's Devouring Wolf formation with Jing Yuan, beheading three Brood Lords. He also fought viciously against the wingweavers, ultimately sinking their almighty Cloudseizer Fleet... These are just a small footnote in the annals of his courageous swordplay.",

He knows different sword's spec and function like the back of his mind. He'll even buy an extra copy \u2014 one to use in combat, and one for his collection. This leaves his finances in a sorrowful situation at the end of each month, where he could only beg the general for food and daily necessities.<br /><br />It's completely natural for teenage boys to love swords, but a specific dream flickers and dances among the Xianzhou swords in his collection.<br /><br />To become the best on the Luofu \u2014 no, the best across all the Xianzhou ships. To take the title of Sword Champion on the Luofu, and even take the title of Sword Preeminence across the Alliance. <br /><br />Since the Sedition of Imbibitor Lunae, the title of Sword Champion among the Luofu Cloud Knights has remained vacant for centuries. Not that nobody wants to claim it, but for a rather more embarrassing reason:<br /><br />The previous Sword Champion, a legendary swordmaster with <nobr>13</nobr> outstanding accolades, violated the laws of heaven and resulting in her name being wiped from the face of the galaxy.

Some speculated that he was cultivating an heir, others claimed he only kept him around just to use this kid as a secret weapon. Jing Yuan never offered a response.<br /><br />Yanqing became an unrivaled fighter aboard the Xianzhou Luofu as his skills grew more and more advanced. Jing Yuan gradually began thinking about ways to restrain Yanqing's edge, to take him down a peg without curbing his confidence.<br /><br />Too solid and it can shatter. Too sharp and it can blunt. More than just a sharp edge \u2014 a sword also needs a scabbard that can restrain it. In Jing Yuan's view, Yanqing has grown up exceedingly fast \u2014 beyond expectations. What Yanqing needs right now is not more strength, but the ability and experience of curbing that strength \u2014 something that can only manifest by the passage of time.",
